# Streaming Start Journey with Project Context ‚úÖ

## Overview

Implemented AI-generated, streaming opening messages for each helper with full project context and unique helper personalities.

## What Changed

### 1. **Streaming Opening Message**
Instead of a hardcoded greeting, the helper's first message is now:
- ‚úÖ **AI-generated** based on helper's unique personality
- ‚úÖ **Streaming** word-by-word like normal chat
- ‚úÖ **Context-aware** about the user's project
- ‚úÖ **Task-informed** about what needs to be done

### 2. **Project Context Integration**
Each helper now knows:
- ‚úÖ **Project name** and **description**
- ‚úÖ **Tech stack** (when available)
- ‚úÖ **Current stage** (when available)
- ‚úÖ **Current step** in the journey
- ‚úÖ **Specific tasks** to accomplish

### 3. **Unique Helper Personalities**
Each helper speaks from their unique role:
- **Muse** üåü - Playful, strategic ideator
- **Architect** üèóÔ∏è - Methodical, practical planner
- **Crafter** ‚ú® - Visual, design-focused creator  
- **Hacker** üîß - Direct, pragmatic builder
- **Hypebeast** üì£ - Energetic launch strategist
- **Sensei** üßò - Wise growth mentor

## Implementation Details

### Frontend: `components/chat/chat-interface.tsx`

#### Added `project` Prop
```typescript
interface ChatInterfaceProps {
  // ... other props
  project?: {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    techStack?: string;
    stage?: string;
  };
}
```

#### Updated `handleStartJourney()`
Now calls the API with streaming enabled:

```typescript
const handleStartJourney = async () => {
  setIsLoading(true);
  setIsStreaming(true);

  // Create empty assistant message
  const assistantMessage: ChatMessage = {
    id: Date.now().toString(),
    role: "assistant",
    content: "", // Will be filled by streaming
  };

  // Add to chat history
  setChatHistories((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    [helper]: [...prev[helper], assistantMessage],
  }));

  // Call API with startJourney flag
  const response = await fetch("/api/chat", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      helper,
      message: "",
      startJourney: true, // Special flag
      context: {
        projectName: project?.name || "Untitled Project",
        projectDescription: project?.description,
        projectTechStack: project?.techStack,
        projectStage: project?.stage,
        currentStep: stepContext,
        tasks,
        requiredTasks: stepContext?.requiredTasks,
      },
    }),
  });

  // Stream the response into the message
  // (streaming code...)
};
```

**Key Changes:**
- Creates empty message first
- Calls API with `startJourney: true` flag
- Streams AI response into the message
- Includes full project context

#### Updated `handleSubmitMessage()`
Now includes project context in all messages:

```typescript
context: {
  projectName: project?.name || "My First Project",
  projectDescription: project?.description,
  projectTechStack: project?.techStack,
  projectStage: project?.stage,
  // ... rest of context
}
```

---

### Backend: `app/api/chat/route.ts`

#### Added `startJourney` Flag
```typescript
interface ChatRequestBody {
  helper: HelperType;
  message: string;
  startJourney?: boolean; // New flag
  context?: {
    projectName?: string;
    projectDescription?: string;
    projectTechStack?: string; // New
    projectStage?: string; // New
    // ... rest
  };
}
```

#### Handle Opening Message Generation
```typescript
let userMessage = message;
if (startJourney) {
  // Special prompt for opening message
  userMessage = `Generate your opening message to greet the user and start the conversation. Introduce yourself with your personality, acknowledge the project and current step, list the tasks we'll work on, and ask the user to share their current situation (where they are, what they want to focus on, constraints).`;
}

// Stream response with full context
const stream = await createStreamingChatCompletion(
  helper,
  [{ role: "user", content: userMessage }],
  helperContext
);
```

**How It Works:**
1. When `startJourney: true`, generates special prompt
2. Prompt instructs AI to create opening message
3. AI uses helper's personality + project context
4. Streams back personalized greeting

---

### LLM Provider: `lib/llm/provider.ts`

#### Expanded `HelperContext`
```typescript
export interface HelperContext {
  projectName?: string;
  projectDescription?: string;
  projectTechStack?: string; // New
  projectStage?: string; // New
  currentStep?: {
    levelTitle: string;
    stepTitle: string;
    cta: string;
  };
  tasks?: Array<Task>;
  requiredTasks?: string[];
}
```

#### Enhanced Context Building
```typescript
if (context.projectName) {
  prompt += `\n**Project:** ${context.projectName}`;
  if (context.projectDescription) {
    prompt += ` ‚Äî ${context.projectDescription}`;
  }
  if (context.projectTechStack) {
    prompt += `\n**Tech Stack:** ${context.projectTechStack}`;
  }
  if (context.projectStage) {
    prompt += `\n**Current Stage:** ${context.projectStage}`;
  }
}
```

**Result:** Helpers have full project awareness in every response

---

### Dashboard: `components/dashboard/dashboard-layout.tsx`

#### Pass Project to ChatInterface
```typescript
<ChatInterface 
  helper={selectedHelper}
  // ... other props
  project={project ? {
    name: project.name,
    description: project.description,
    techStack: undefined, // Can be added later
    stage: undefined, // Can be added later
  } : undefined}
/>
```
