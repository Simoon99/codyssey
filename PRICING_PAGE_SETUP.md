## Installation Steps

### 1. Create the Marketing Folder Structure

If you don't already have it, create:
```bash
mkdir -p app/(marketing)/pricing
```

The pricing page is already in `app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx`

### 2. Update the Pricing Constants

The `constants/plans.ts` file contains the pricing data. Customize the HELPERS array with your own helpers:

```typescript
const HELPERS: Helper[] = [
  {
    id: 'marketing',
    name: 'Your Helper Name',
    emoji: 'ðŸŽ¯',
    role: 'Your Role',
    description: 'Your description',
    color: 'from-blue-500 to-cyan-500',
    icon: YourIcon,
    price: 39,
    benefits: ['Benefit 1', 'Benefit 2'],
  },
];
```

### 3. Pricing Tiers

Update pricing in BUNDLE_PRICING_TIERS and INDIVIDUAL_PRICING_TIERS arrays:

```typescript
const BUNDLE_PRICING_TIERS: PricingTier[] = [
  {
    id: 'yearly',
    name: 'Pay Yearly',
    originalPrice: 97,
    discountedPrice: 15.60,
    billingPeriod: '/month',
    description: 'Billed annually',
  },
];
```

## Customization Guide

### Change Countdown Timer

Find `CountdownTimer` function and modify initial values:
```typescript
const [timeLeft, setTimeLeft] = useState({
  hours: 2,
  minutes: 6,
  seconds: 19
});
```

### Change Banner Text

```typescript
<span className="font-semibold text-base">Summer Sale: 60% OFF</span>
```

### Change Button Colors

Update CTA button colors from green:
```typescript
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-600 to-green-500"
```

### Update Links

Replace all `#` with real links:
```typescript
link: "/checkout"
```

- TrendingUp, Briefcase, DollarSign, BarChart, Users, Mail, Code, ShoppingCart, PenTool, MessageSquare, Lightbulb, X, Check, Zap, Globe, Brain, Shield, Clock, Star, Bot

## Component Structure
