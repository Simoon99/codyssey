## XP Progression

**No XP Gating** ✅ — Users can access any level at any time.

### XP Awards by Level
- Level 1 tasks: 15–25 XP (avg 20)
- Level 2 tasks: 20–30 XP (avg 25)
- Level 3 tasks: 20–50 XP (avg 35)
- Level 4 tasks: 20–60 XP (avg 40)
- Level 5 tasks: 25–100 XP (avg 50)

### Optional Task Bonus
Optional tasks reward **1.5–2x** the XP of required tasks to incentivize depth.

### Total Possible XP
- If all required tasks: ~1,030 XP
- If all tasks (required + optional): ~2,500+ XP

---

## Progression Logic

```
User completes all REQUIRED tasks in Level N
                    ↓
Automatic level-up to Level N+1
                    ↓
XP accumulates (for gamification, not gating)
```

**NO XP THRESHOLD.** Just complete tasks.

## Key Dates & Milestones

- **Level 1 Done**: User has validated MVP scope with user evidence
- **Level 2 Done**: User has repo, schema, and milestone plan
- **Level 3 Done**: User has demoable MVP (locally)
- **Level 4 Done**: User has production live + launch executed + feedback
- **Level 5 Done**: User has 100+ users + repeatable growth loop

## Common Paths

### Fast Track (MVP Launch)
```
L1 (2-3 days) → L2 (2-3 days) → L3 (1-2 weeks) → L4 (3-5 days) = ~3 weeks to launch
```

### Thorough Track (MVP + Polish)
```
L1 (1 week) + opt tasks → L2 (1 week) + opt tasks → L3 (2-3 weeks) + opt tasks → L4 (1 week) = ~6-8 weeks to launch
```

### Power User (Jumping Around)
```
Skip to L3 if experience → only do required tasks you need → skip optional depth = Flexible!
```

## Integration Checklist

- [ ] Seed new tasks to database (`db/seed.sql`)
- [ ] Verify all levels have `xp_required = 0`
- [ ] Update `progression.ts` to use task-based logic (done ✅)
- [ ] Load `journey-config.json` in frontend
- [ ] Render 15 orbs (5 levels × 3 steps) from config
- [ ] Auto-populate first message from `step.firstMessage`
- [ ] Load helper system prompts from `JOURNEY_FRAMEWORK.md`
- [ ] Display acceptance criteria checklists on task detail
- [ ] Test progression: complete required tasks → auto-level-up
- [ ] Monitor user progression through levels
