# State Persistence Fix - Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### Problem Statement
When closing and reopening the helper (switching between Journey and Chat views), the system was losing:
1. ❌ Chat history cards (session list)
2. ❌ Chat content (messages)
3. ❌ Active orb visualization

### Root Causes Identified

#### 1. StepContext Being Cleared
**Location:** `components/dashboard/dashboard-layout.tsx`

When clicking a helper from the sidebar or clicking "New Chat", the code was clearing `stepContext` with `setStepContext(null)`. This caused the active orb ID to be lost, so when navigating back to the journey view, no orb appeared active.

**Lines affected:**
- Line 119: When helper selected from sidebar
- Line 133: When "New Chat" clicked

#### 2. Session Cache Not Updated on Journey Start
**Location:** `components/chat/chat-interface.tsx`

When starting a journey and creating a new session, the session was added to the component state (`setSessions`) but NOT added to the `sessionsCache`. This meant:
- The cache remained empty
- When switching views and back, the useEffect would find no cached sessions
- UI would clear because no sessions were found

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Preserve StepContext Across View Changes ✅

**File:** `components/dashboard/dashboard-layout.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// No orb data - sidebar or direct helper selection
else {
  setStepContext(null);  // ❌ This cleared the active orb state
  setFilteredTasks([]);
  setShowTasksInChat(false);
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// No orb data - sidebar or direct helper selection
else {
  // Don't clear stepContext - preserve active orb state
  // Only clear tasks since this is direct helper selection
  setFilteredTasks([]);
  setShowTasksInChat(false);
}
```

**Also fixed in `handleNewChat()`:**
```typescript
const handleNewChat = () => {
  // When opening new chat from sidebar, don't show tasks
  // But preserve stepContext to maintain active orb state
  setShowTasksInChat(false);
  setFilteredTasks([]);
  setViewMode("chat");
  setSidebarOpen(false);
};
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Active orb state persists when switching between journey and chat views
- ✅ Clicking helper from sidebar doesn't lose the active orb
- ✅ "New Chat" button preserves active orb state

### Fix 2: Update Session Cache When Journey Starts ✅

**File:** `components/chat/chat-interface.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
if (response.ok) {
  const { session: newSession } = await response.json();
  activeSession = newSession;
  setSessions((prev) => [newSession, ...prev]);
  setCurrentSession(newSession);
  // ❌ Cache not updated
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (response.ok) {
  const { session: newSession } = await response.json();
  activeSession = newSession;
  setSessions((prev) => [newSession, ...prev]);
  setCurrentSession(newSession);
  
  // ✅ Update cache with new session
  const existingCache = sessionsCache.current.get(helper) || [];
  sessionsCache.current.set(helper, [newSession, ...existingCache]);
  console.log("[handleStartJourney] Added new session to cache for", helper);
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Session cache is updated immediately when journey starts
- ✅ Chat history cards persist when switching views
- ✅ Messages remain loaded when returning to helper

## How It Works Now

### User Flow: Start Journey → Switch Views → Return

1. **User clicks "Start Your Journey" with Muse**
   ```
   → Creates new session
   → Initializes journey with tasks
   → Adds session to state AND cache
   → Sets stepContext with orbId="L1S1"
   ```

2. **User switches to Journey view (clicks home icon)**
   ```
   → viewMode changes to "journey"
   → stepContext PRESERVED
   → activeOrbId={stepContext?.orbId} = "L1S1"
   → Muse orb shows active state ✅
   ```

3. **User clicks Muse helper from sidebar**
   ```
   → handleHelperSelect("muse") called with no orb data
   → stepContext NOT cleared (still has orbId="L1S1") ✅
   → viewMode changes to "chat"
   → Sessions loaded from cache ✅
   → Messages displayed ✅
   ```

### State Preservation Map

| State | Location | Persistence Method |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **stepContext** | `dashboard-layout.tsx` state | ✅ Never cleared, only updated |
| **Sessions** | `chat-interface.tsx` state + cache | ✅ Stored in `sessionsCache.current` |
| **Messages** | `chat-interface.tsx` state + cache | ✅ Stored in `messageCache.current` |
| **Journey Tasks** | `chat-interface.tsx` state | ✅ Reloaded from API, but persists in state |
| **Active Orb** | Derived from `stepContext.orbId` | ✅ Persists via stepContext |

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Scenario 1: Start Journey and Switch Views
1. Click "Start Your Journey" with Muse
2. Send a message
3. Click home icon (journey view)
4. Verify Muse orb is active (ring-4 shadow-2xl)
5. Click Muse helper from sidebar
6. Verify chat history card appears
7. Verify messages are still there

### ✅ Scenario 2: Multiple Helpers
1. Start journey with Muse (send messages)
2. Switch to Architect from sidebar
3. Start journey with Architect (send messages)
4. Switch back to Muse
5. Verify Muse chat history and messages intact
6. Go to journey view
7. Verify Architect orb is active (last helper)
8. Click Muse orb
9. Verify Muse becomes active

### ✅ Scenario 3: New Chat Button
1. Have an active helper with messages
2. Click "New Chat" from sidebar
3. Go to journey view
4. Verify orb still shows active state
5. Return to chat
6. Previous session should be in history

## Files Modified

1. **`components/dashboard/dashboard-layout.tsx`**
   - Removed `setStepContext(null)` from `handleHelperSelect` (line 119)
   - Removed `setStepContext(null)` from `handleNewChat` (line 133)

2. **`components/chat/chat-interface.tsx`**
   - Added session cache update in `handleStartJourney` (lines 722-725)

## What's Preserved Now

✅ **Active Orb State** - Persists across all view changes  
✅ **Chat History Cards** - Loaded from cache instantly  
✅ **Chat Messages** - Preserved per helper via cache  
✅ **Journey Tasks** - Reloaded but persist in component state  
✅ **Current Session** - Maintained in component state  

## No Breaking Changes

All existing functionality remains intact:
- ✅ Creating new chats works
- ✅ Switching helpers works
- ✅ Starting journeys works
- ✅ Completing tasks works
- ✅ Message streaming works

The fixes only added persistence - they didn't change any core functionality.
