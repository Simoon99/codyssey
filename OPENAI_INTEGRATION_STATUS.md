# 🤖 OpenAI Integration Status

## ✅ Completed - Backend (API & System Prompts)

### 1. Enhanced System Prompts (`lib/llm/provider.ts`)
- **Context-Aware AI**: Helpers now receive full context about:
  - Project name and description
  - Current level and step
  - Active tasks (required and optional)
  - Task completion status
  
- **6 Helper Personalities**:
  - **Muse**: Ideation and market validation
  - **Architect**: Technical planning and architecture
  - **Crafter**: UI/UX design and brand
  - **Hacker**: Debugging and implementation
  - **Hypebeast**: Launch and marketing
  - **Sensei**: Growth and scaling

- **Features**:
  - System prompts reference specific tasks
  - Celebrate completed tasks
  - Provide task-specific guidance
  - Max tokens increased to 1200

### 2. Chat API (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- **No Auth Required**: Simplified for demo mode
- **Context Passing**: Accepts project and task context
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time SSE streaming
- **Clean Interface**: Edge runtime for performance

## 🔨 TODO - Frontend (Chat Interface)

### Next Step: Update `components/chat/chat-interface.tsx`

**Current State**: Uses hardcoded mock responses
**Goal**: Make real API calls with context

**What Needs to Change**:
1. Replace mock response logic with real API calls
2. Pass task context to API
3. Pass project context to API
4. Pass step context (level/step/CTA) to API
5. Handle real-time streaming from OpenAI
6. Handle errors gracefully

**API Call Structure**:
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    helper,
    message: currentInput,
    projectId: 'demo-1',
    context: {
      projectName: 'My First Project',
      projectDescription: 'Building something amazing',
      currentStep: {
        levelTitle: 'Spark',
        stepTitle: 'Problem & Market Scan',
        cta: 'Define your problem & market',
      },
      tasks: tasks,
      requiredTasks: tasks.filter(t => t.required).map(t => t.id),
    },
  }),
});
```

### Additional Improvements Needed:
1. **Send first message from stepContext** when orb is clicked
2. **Store chat history** (currently in state, could persist)
3. **Handle slow network** (loading states)
4. **Error recovery** (retry logic)

## 📊 System Flow

```
User clicks orb 
  → JourneyView passes stepContext
  → Dashboard passes tasks + stepContext to ChatInterface
  → User sends message
  → ChatInterface calls /api/chat with full context
  → API passes context to LLM Provider
  → LLM Provider builds contextual system prompt
  → OpenAI generates context-aware response
  → Streams back to user
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Context-Aware AI

1. **Task-Specific Guidance**: AI knows exactly what tasks user needs to complete
2. **Progress Tracking**: AI can celebrate completed tasks and suggest next steps
3. **Project Awareness**: Responses tailored to the specific project
4. **Level-Appropriate**: Advice matches current journey stage
5. **Actionable**: AI can reference specific tasks by name

## 🔑 Key Files

- `lib/llm/provider.ts` - ✅ System prompts + context building
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - ✅ Chat API endpoint
- `components/chat/chat-interface.tsx` - ⏳ Frontend integration (TODO)
- `lib/journey-config.json` - ✅ All step/task definitions
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - ✅ 70+ demo tasks

## 🚀 Next Actions

1. Update `handleSubmit` in chat-interface.tsx to call real API
2. Test with OpenAI API key
3. Add firstMessage auto-population when step starts
4. Handle streaming properly
5. Deploy to Vercel
6. Test all 6 helpers with different tasks

**Status**: Backend complete, frontend integration in progress
