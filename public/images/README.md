# Landing Page Images

This directory contains the images required for the landing page components.

## Required Images

Please add the following images to this directory:

### Hero Section
- **dashboard.png** - Main hero dashboard screenshot/mockup

### Features Section
- **feature-one.svg** - First feature illustration
- **feature-two.svg** - Second feature illustration
- **feature-three.svg** - Third feature illustration
- **feature-four.svg** - Fourth feature illustration
- **feature-five.svg** - Fifth feature illustration

### Integration Section
- **integration.svg** - Integration diagram/illustration

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: PNG for screenshots, SVG for illustrations (preferred for scalability)
- **Size**: Optimize images for web (compress without losing quality)
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Dashboard image: Recommended minimum 1200px width
  - Feature images: 400-600px width
  - Integration image: 800-1000px width

## Next Steps

1. Copy the images from your source project to this directory
2. OR create/design new images that match your brand
3. Ensure image filenames match exactly as listed above
4. Test the landing page to verify all images load correctly

## Alternative Approach

If you don't have the images yet, you can:
1. Use placeholder services (like placeholder.com)
2. Update the component files to use different image paths
3. Use your own custom images with different names (update component imports)
