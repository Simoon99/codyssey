## Context Provided to Helpers

Each helper receives:

```typescript
{
  projectName: "TaskMaster Pro",
  projectDescription: "AI-powered task management for busy professionals",
  projectTechStack: "Next.js, PostgreSQL, OpenAI", // optional
  projectStage: "Building MVP", // optional
  currentStep: {
    levelTitle: "Level 1",
    stepTitle: "L1S1",
    cta: "Define your problem & market"
  },
  tasks: [
    {
      id: "define-problem",
      title: "Define the Problem",
      description: "Clearly articulate the problem you're solving",
      required: true,
      status: "todo",
      xp_reward: 50
    },
    // ... more tasks
  ],
  requiredTasks: ["define-problem", "research-competition"]
}
```

This context enables helpers to provide:
- **Specific advice** tailored to the project
