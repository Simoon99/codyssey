# Web Search Capability for Helpers Agent

## Overview

Web search capability has been successfully added to the Vibecoding Helpers Agent! This allows helpers to search the internet in real-time, enabling them to:

- Find current information not in their training data
- Research latest frameworks, libraries, and best practices
- Discover recent competitor launches and market trends
- Access real-time documentation and code examples
- Find case studies and optimization techniques

## Implementation Details

### Which Helpers Have Web Search?

| Helper | Use Case | When They Use It |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Muse** | Market research | Finding recent competitor launches, market trends |
| **Architect** | Technical research | Finding latest framework docs, architecture patterns |
| **Hacker** | Implementation | Finding debugging solutions, code patterns, library docs |
| **Sensei** | Optimization | Finding optimization techniques, case studies, best practices |
| **Crafter** | Design (optional) | Could be useful for UI/UX trends |
| **Hypebeast** | Launch info | Could be useful for marketing channel research |

### How It Works

1. **User asks a question** that requires current information
2. **Helper autonomously decides** whether to use web search
3. **Search is executed** using the DuckDuckGo API (free, no key required)
4. **Results are returned** with titles, URLs, and snippets
5. **Helper uses results** to answer the user's question with current info

### Example Usage

**User:** "What's the best way to implement authentication in Next.js 15?"

**Hacker's response:**
1. Recognizes this needs current information
2. Calls `web_search` with "Next.js 15 authentication best practices 2024"
3. Gets latest docs and examples
4. Synthesizes answer using real-time data
5. Provides up-to-date guidance

## Current Implementation

### Free Search API (DuckDuckGo)

```typescript
// Works out of the box - no API key needed!
const searchUrl = new URL("https://api.duckduckgo.com/");
searchUrl.searchParams.append("q", args.query);
searchUrl.searchParams.append("format", "json");
// Returns results with titles, URLs, and snippets
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Free (no API key required)
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No setup needed
- ✅ Reliable and fast

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Limited to ~5-10 results per query
- ⚠️ May have fewer results than premium APIs
- ⚠️ Rate-limited (reasonable for user interactions)

## Upgrading to Premium Search APIs (Optional)

To get even better search results, you can upgrade to a paid service:

### Option 1: Brave Search API

**Free tier:** 2,000 queries/month

```bash
# Add to .env
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

```typescript
// Implementation
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=${query}&key=${process.env.BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY}`
);
const data = await response.json();
```

### Option 2: Serper API

**Free tier:** 100 searches/month

```bash
# Add to .env
SERPER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

```typescript
const response = await fetch("https://google.serper.dev/search", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "X-API-KEY": process.env.SERPER_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ q: query }),
});
```

### Option 3: SerpAPI

**Free tier:** 100 searches/month

```bash
# Add to .env
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

```typescript
const serpapi = require("google-search-results-nodejs");
const search = new serpapi.GoogleSearch(process.env.SERPAPI_API_KEY);
// See SerpAPI docs for full implementation
```

## File Changes

### 1. `lib/llm/agent-tools.ts`

**Added:**
- `web_search` tool definition to `AGENT_TOOLS`
- `web_search` to `HELPER_TOOL_CONFIGS` for Muse, Architect, Hacker, Sensei
- `searchWeb()` implementation function
- `web_search` case in `executeToolCall` switch statement

**Key Features:**
- Limits results to max 10 (configurable)
- Falls back gracefully if search fails
- Extracts titles, URLs, and snippets from results
- Handles DuckDuckGo's RelatedTopics for better coverage

### 2. `lib/llm/agent-provider.ts`

**Updated:**
- Muse's instructions mention "Search the web for real-time market trends"
- Architect's instructions mention "latest documentation, framework releases"
- Hacker's instructions mention "latest documentation, debugging patterns"
- Sensei's instructions mention "latest optimization techniques and success stories"

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Muse Researching Market

```
User: "What are people building with AI right now?"

Muse calls:
  web_search("AI products 2024 trending startups")
  → Gets latest AI product launches
  → Searches "AI startup trends November 2024"
  → Returns current market information
  → Synthesizes into insights
```

### Example 2: Hacker Debugging

```
User: "I'm getting a CORS error with my Next.js API"

Hacker calls:
  web_search("Next.js CORS error fix 2024")
  → Gets latest solutions
  → Reviews StackOverflow answers, GitHub issues
  → Provides current best practices
```

### Example 3: Sensei Optimizing

```
User: "How can I optimize database queries?"

Sensei calls:
  web_search("database query optimization best practices 2024")
  → Gets latest performance tips
  → Finds recent case studies
  → Returns current optimization techniques
```

## Configuration

### Default Settings

```typescript
// Max results per search
const numResults = Math.min(args.num_results || 5, 10);

// Search source
const source = "DuckDuckGo"; // Can be changed to "Brave", "Serper", etc.
```

### Environment Variables

Current implementation requires **no environment variables** - it works with the free DuckDuckGo API.

To upgrade to premium search:

```bash
# Add one of these to .env.local
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_key
SERPER_API_KEY=your_key
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_key
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Smart Query Expansion
Automatically expand simple queries with context:
```typescript
// Instead of: "authentication"
// Use: "Next.js 15 Supabase authentication 2024"
```

### 2. Result Caching
Cache search results for 24 hours to reduce API calls:
```typescript
const cache = new Map<string, CachedResults>();
// Check cache before searching
```

### 3. Source Prioritization
Rank sources by reliability:
```typescript
const sourceScores = {
  "github.com": 10,
  "docs.*.com": 9,
  "stackoverflow.com": 8,
  // ...
};
```

### 4. Multi-Source Fallback
If DuckDuckGo fails, try other APIs:
```typescript
try {
  return await searchWithDuckDuckGo(query);
} catch {
  return await searchWithBraveAPI(query);
}
```

### 5. Answer Extraction
Use AI to synthesize results into direct answers:
```typescript
// Instead of just returning URLs
// Have OpenAI synthesize results into a coherent answer
const answer = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `Summarize these search results: ${JSON.stringify(results)}`
    }
  ]
});
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Start the development server
2. Open chat with a helper
3. Ask a question that needs current information
4. Watch browser console for logs
5. Verify search results appear in the response

### Example Queries to Test

```
Muse:
- "What AI tools are trending right now?"
- "Latest SaaS pricing strategies"

Architect:
- "What's new in Next.js 15?"
- "Latest Supabase features"

Hacker:
- "How to implement rate limiting in Node.js?"
- "Best practices for React 19"

Sensei:
- "Latest performance optimization techniques"
- "How to implement analytics tracking"
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Results Returned

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Try a different search query
3. Verify internet connection
4. Check DuckDuckGo API status

### Results Look Outdated

This might happen with DuckDuckGo's free API. Consider upgrading to:
- Brave Search (fresher index)
- Serper (Google Search powered)
- SerpAPI (Real-time)

### Rate Limiting

DuckDuckGo has reasonable rate limits for normal use. If you hit limits:
1. Implement caching
2. Upgrade to paid API with higher limits
3. Implement exponential backoff retry logic

## Security Considerations

✅ **Safe:**
- Search queries are user-provided strings
- Results come from trusted search APIs
- URLs are presented as-is (user controls clicking)

⚠️ **Monitor:**
- Don't expose API keys in frontend code
- All searches happen on server-side (`lib/llm/` is server code)
- Rate limiting is automatic with APIs

## Performance Impact

- **DuckDuckGo API:** ~200-500ms per search
- **Brave API:** ~300-600ms per search
- **Network dependent** - may vary based on connection

To minimize impact:
1. Implement result caching
2. Search intelligently (don't search for everything)
3. Limit results returned
4. Use async/await properly

## Next Steps

1. **Test current implementation** - Try asking helpers for current information
2. **Monitor performance** - Check if response times are acceptable
3. **Consider upgrade** - If you need more results, upgrade to paid API
4. **Implement caching** - Cache results for common queries
5. **Add synthesis** - Have AI summarize results instead of just listing them

## Questions?

If you need help:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Review the implementation in `lib/llm/agent-tools.ts`
3. Test with different search queries
4. Upgrade to premium API if needed
