# Project Card Data Fix - Complete ✅

## Problem Identified
The project card was expecting `goal`, `location`, and `avatarUrl` fields but these fields were missing from the database schema. The API routes were trying to save these fields, but they didn't exist in the database, causing data to be lost or not displayed correctly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### Added Missing Fields to Projects Table
**File: `db/schema.sql`**
- Added `goal TEXT` - Project goal or target (e.g., "Launch in 30 days")
- Added `location TEXT` - Project location or team location
- Added `avatar_url TEXT` - URL or data URI for project avatar image
- Consolidated all project context fields in one place for clarity

#### Created Migration for Existing Databases
**File: `db/migrations/add_project_display_fields.sql`**
- New migration file that adds `goal`, `location`, and `avatar_url` columns
- Safe to run on existing databases (uses `IF NOT EXISTS`)
- Includes helpful comments for documentation

#### Updated Dev Setup with Complete Demo Data
**File: `db/dev-setup.sql`**
- Updated demo project to include all new fields:
  - `goal`: "Launch in 30 days"
  - `location`: "Massachusetts, United States"
  - `problem_statement`, `target_audience`, `value_proposition`, `tech_stack`, `current_stage`
- Demo data now matches the actual schema and provides a complete example

### 2. API Route Fixes

**File: `app/api/projects/[id]/context/route.ts`**
- ✅ Added `avatar_url: body.avatarUrl` to the update query
- ✅ Fixed `user_id` → `owner_id` (to match schema column names)
- Now correctly saves and retrieves all project fields including avatar

### 3. Component Updates

#### Dashboard Layout
**File: `components/dashboard/dashboard-layout.tsx`**
- Updated `JourneyView` to receive `projectContext` data from the database instead of hardcoded demo data
- Maps database fields correctly:
  - `avatar_url` → `avatarUrl`
  - `external_links` → `links`
- Falls back to `project` prop if `projectContext` is not yet loaded

#### Journey View
**File: `components/dashboard/journey-view.tsx`**
- Added `avatarUrl?: string` to the project interface
- Updated `ProjectCard` to pass `avatarUrl` field
- Project card now receives all expected fields from database

### 4. Project Card Component
**File: `components/dashboard/project-card.tsx`**
- Already had proper interface expecting `goal`, `location`, and `avatarUrl`
- No changes needed - now receives correct data from parent components

## Data Flow (Fixed)

```
Database (projects table)
  ├── id, name, description
  ├── goal, location, avatar_url ✅ NEW
  ├── problem_statement, target_audience, value_proposition
  └── tech_stack, current_stage, external_links
         ↓
API Route (/api/projects/[id]/context)
  ├── Fetches all fields from database
  └── Returns project with all fields ✅
         ↓
Dashboard Layout (loads projectContext)
  ├── Stores full project data in state
  └── Maps database fields to component props ✅
         ↓
Journey View
  ├── Receives project with all fields
  └── Passes to ProjectCard ✅
         ↓
Project Card
  └── Displays: name, description, goal, location, avatar ✅
```

## What's Fixed

✅ **Database Schema** - All required fields now exist  
✅ **API Routes** - Correctly save and load all fields  
✅ **Data Flow** - Database → API → Components → UI  
✅ **Project Card** - Displays all correct data  
✅ **Demo Data** - Dev setup includes complete project data  
✅ **Type Safety** - All interfaces updated with correct types  

## Migration Required

If you have an existing database, run this migration:

```sql
-- Add the new fields
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS goal TEXT;
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS location TEXT;
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS avatar_url TEXT;
```

Or use the migration file:
```bash
# Run migration on your Supabase database
psql -h your-db-host -U postgres -d postgres -f db/migrations/add_project_display_fields.sql
```

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Check Database**: Verify the columns exist in your `projects` table
2. **Edit Project**: Click the edit button on the project card
3. **Update Fields**: Change the goal, location, or upload an avatar
4. **Save**: Click save and refresh the page
5. **Verify**: All data should persist and display correctly

## Next Steps

The project card now correctly displays all data from the database. The data flow is working end-to-end:
- Database has all required fields ✅
- API saves and loads data correctly ✅
- Components receive and display data properly ✅
