## FAQs
**What makes Codyssey different from a normal AI chat?**
Codyssey combines specialized helper personas, a structured journey, and task-based progress — so you always have context, direction, and momentum.

**Do I have to follow the levels in order?**
No. Levels are not gated; progression is task-based. You can jump to the level that matches your current focus.

**Does it work with my existing tools?**
Yes. Keep using Cursor, Lovable, Bolt, GitHub, and your preferred stack. Codyssey integrates into your flow rather than replacing it.

**How does Codyssey personalize guidance?**
You provide project context (problem, audience, tech stack, stage). Helpers use that to tailor their recommendations and examples.

**Is this for beginners or advanced builders?**
Both. Beginners get structure and direction; advanced builders get acceleration and clarity.
