```json
{
  "levels": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Spark",
      "steps": [
        { "helper": "muse", "tasks": ["define-problem", "research-competition", "identify-target-audience", "market-size-analysis"], "cta": "Define your problem & market" },
        { "helper": "architect", "tasks": ["brainstorm-solutions", "validate-idea", "user-interview-analysis", "create-value-hypothesis"], "cta": "Validate with users" },
        { "helper": "crafter", "tasks": ["define-mvp-scope", "create-user-stories", "design-success-metrics"], "cta": "Lock in MVP scope" }

## Implementation Notes

1. **Levels are not XP-gated**: Set all `xp_required = 0` in levels table.
2. **Progression is task-based**: Check `checkAndApplyLevelUp()` logic uses required task completion, not XP.
3. **Helper chats auto-populate**: When user starts a task, pass the step's CTA as first message.
4. **Optional tasks**: Show them, but don't block progression.
5. **Acceptance criteria**: Display as checklist on task detail; help users know when they're done.
