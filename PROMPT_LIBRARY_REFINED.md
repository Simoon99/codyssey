## Stage 1: Muse Templates (Ideation)

### **🎯 Vibecoding Focus: Understanding Possibility**

**New Templates (Vibecoding-Focused):**
1. **Choose AI Tools** - "What tools should I use for this project?"
2. **Estimate Build Time** - "How fast can I build with AI vs traditional?"

**Existing Templates (Kept):**
3. Problem Statement
4. Competitive Landscape
5. Value Proposition
6. Define MVP Scope
7. Validate Your Idea

### **Key Changes:**
- ✅ Added tool selection template
- ✅ Added build time estimation template
- ❌ Removed: User Interview Prep, Pricing Strategy (not vibecoding-focused)
- ✅ All templates now emphasize "what's possible with AI"

### **Example Template:**
```
Title: "Choose AI Tools"
Description: "What tools to build with"

Prompt: "Let's pick the perfect AI tools for your project. Tell me: 
What you're building, your technical experience level, and your timeline. 
I'll recommend the optimal tool stack (Lovable/Bolt/Cursor/v0) and show 
you how fast you can build with each. Time to blow your mind! ⚡"
```

4. **Design API Structure** - RESTful + tech prompt generation
5. **Review Architecture** - Check AI-friendliness

Prompt: "Let's design a system architecture that AI tools can easily 
modify. Tell me: Your main features and data flow. I'll help you create: 
Clear naming conventions, focused functions, explicit types, and 
consistent patterns. AI works best with clean, predictable structures!"
```

scoring system (0-100) and show you EXACTLY what's missing: Context? 
Edge cases? File locations? Then I'll generate a perfect version that 
scores 90+. This is how you become a 10x vibecoder!"
