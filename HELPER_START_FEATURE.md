## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files

#### `lib/llm/task-prompts.ts`
Comprehensive library of task completion prompts with:
- **40+ tasks** across all 5 levels of the journey
- **Detailed guidance** for each task including:
  - Step-by-step implementation instructions
  - Completion criteria checklist
  - Proactive suggestions for next steps
  - Examples and templates
  - Best practices and common pitfalls

**Key Functions:**
- `getTaskGuidance(taskId)` - Get specific task prompt
- `getHelperTasks(helper)` - Get all tasks for a helper
- `buildTaskAwarePrompt(taskIds)` - Build enhanced system prompt with task guidance

### Modified Files

#### `lib/llm/provider.ts`
Enhanced the LLM provider to include task-specific guidance:
- Imports task prompts library
- Automatically includes relevant task guidance in system prompts
- Helpers now have detailed context about how to help with each task

#### `components/chat/chat-interface.tsx`
Added comprehensive Start button experience:
- **Welcome Screen** showing:
  - Helper's name, title, and description
  - Beautiful large emoji representation
  - Prominent "Start Your Journey" button
  - Preview of first 3 tasks to accomplish
  - Distinction between required (★) and optional (○) tasks
- **Start Journey Handler** that:
  - Creates personalized onboarding message based on context
  - Lists the tasks for the current step
  - Asks targeted questions to understand user's status
  - Triggers comprehensive AI response with full task guidance
- **Refactored message handling** for cleaner code

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. User Opens Helper Chat
When a user clicks on a helper from the Journey view:
- Empty state shows welcoming Start screen
- Displays helper personality and upcoming tasks
- Encourages user to begin with prominent button

### 2. User Clicks "Start Your Journey"
The system automatically:
1. Analyzes the current step context
2. Identifies required vs. optional tasks
3. Creates a comprehensive onboarding message asking:
   - Current status (just starting, stuck, partially done)
   - What to focus on first
   - Any constraints (timeline, resources, experience)
4. Sends this as the first user message to the AI

### 3. Helper Responds with Tailored Guidance
The AI helper receives:
- Base personality prompt (energetic, practical, etc.)
- Current step context (level, goal, CTA)
- All tasks with descriptions and status
- **Comprehensive task-specific guidance** from task-prompts.ts
  - Detailed how-to instructions
  - Completion criteria
  - Proactive next-step suggestions

This enables the helper to provide:
- Extremely relevant, actionable advice
- Step-by-step guidance tailored to the specific task
- Context-aware suggestions based on user's situation
