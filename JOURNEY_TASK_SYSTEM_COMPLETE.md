# Journey Task System - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Overview
The full journey task system has been implemented, allowing helpers to have specific tasks that users complete per helper level. When users click "Start Your Journey" with a helper, the system initializes with helper-specific tasks, displays task cards with completion tracking, and shows progress on level cards.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema âœ…
**File:** `db/migrations/create_journey_progress.sql`

Created two new tables:

#### `journey_progress`
Tracks which level/step each user is currently on per project:
- `user_id`, `project_id`, `current_level_id`, `helper`
- `is_active` - Boolean flag for currently active journey step
- `started_at`, `completed_at` timestamps
- Unique constraint per user/project/level/helper

#### `helper_level_tasks`
Tracks task completion for each helper's journey level:
- `user_id`, `project_id`, `helper`, `level_id`, `task_id`
- `task_title`, `task_goal`, `is_required`, `is_completed`
- `xp_reward` - XP awarded on completion
- `completed_at` timestamp
- Unique constraint per user/project/helper/level/task

**To apply:** Run the SQL from `db/migrations/create_journey_progress.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor.

### 2. API Endpoints âœ…

#### POST `/api/journey/initialize`
**Purpose:** Initialize a journey step with tasks for a specific helper

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "projectId": "uuid",
  "helper": "muse",
  "levelId": "L1S1"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "journeyProgress": { ... },
  "tasks": [ ... ]
}
```

**What it does:**
- Deactivates any currently active journey progress
- Creates/updates journey progress record
- Loads task definitions from `journey-config.json`
- Creates task records in the database
- Marks required tasks based on config

#### GET `/api/journey/progress`
**Purpose:** Get journey progress and tasks for a specific helper

**Query Params:**
- `projectId` - The project UUID
- `helper` - Helper name (muse, architect, etc.)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "journeyProgress": { ... },
  "tasks": [ ... ],
  "stats": {
    "totalTasks": 4,
    "completedTasks": 1,
    "requiredTasks": 2,
    "completedRequiredTasks": 0,
    "completionPercentage": 25
  }
}
```

#### POST `/api/journey/tasks/[id]/complete`
**Purpose:** Mark a task as completed and award XP

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task": { ... },
  "xpAwarded": 10,
  "levelCompleted": false,
  "stats": { ... }
}
```

**What it does:**
- Marks task as completed
- Records completion timestamp
- Awards XP (can be integrated with XP system)
- Checks if all required tasks are complete (level completed)
- Returns updated stats

### 3. Chat Interface Updates âœ…
**File:** `components/chat/chat-interface.tsx`

#### New State Management
- `journeyTasks` - Array of tasks for current helper
- `journeyProgress` - Current journey progress data
- `loadingJourney` - Loading state for journey data

#### `handleStartJourney()` Enhancement
When "Start Your Journey" is clicked:
1. Creates a chat session if needed
2. **Calls `/api/journey/initialize`** to set up tasks
3. Activates the journey step in the database
4. Loads helper-specific tasks
5. Starts the helper conversation

#### `loadJourneyProgress()` Function
- Fetches journey progress and tasks for current helper
- Called automatically when helper changes
- Updates task display in real-time

#### Task Display Updates
Tasks now display from `journeyTasks` state:
- âœ“ Green badge for completed tasks
- ! Blue badge for required tasks
- â—‹ Orange badge for optional tasks
- Shows task title and goal
- Displays XP reward
- "Send to Helper" button to ask for help
- "Mark Complete" button (only for incomplete tasks)

#### Task Completion Flow
1. User clicks "Mark Complete" on a task
2. Calls `/api/journey/tasks/[id]/complete`
3. Reloads journey progress to update UI
4. Task disappears from incomplete list
5. Progress percentage updates

### 4. Orb Visual Active State âœ…
**File:** `components/dashboard/journey-view.tsx`

Active orbs now have:
- `animate-pulse` - Pulsing animation
- `shadow-2xl` - Larger shadow
- `ring-4` - Thicker ring border
- Applied to both desktop and mobile orbs

The active orb is determined by `activeOrbId` prop (from `stepContext.orbId`).

### 5. Level Cards Progress Display âœ…
**File:** `components/dashboard/journey-view.tsx`

Orb cards now show:
- **"X/Y tasks"** - Completed vs total tasks
- **"Z% complete"** - Completion percentage
- **"N required"** - Number of required tasks

Example display:
```
2/4 tasks | 50% complete | 2 required
```

Progress is calculated dynamically from the `tasks` prop.

### 6. Journey Config âœ…
**File:** `lib/journey-config.json`

Already properly configured with:
- Task definitions per helper level
- Required vs optional tasks
- Task IDs that match the system
- XP rewards configuration

Example tasks for Muse (L1S1):
- `idea-refinement` (required)
- `create-project-brief` (required)
- `validate-problem` (optional)
- `lock-mvp-scope` (optional)

## How It Works (User Flow)

### 1. User Clicks "Start Your Journey" with Muse
```
User clicks orb â†’ Opens helper card â†’ Clicks "Let's go ðŸš€"
```

### 2. System Initializes Journey
```
â†’ POST /api/journey/initialize
  - Creates journey_progress record (is_active = true)
  - Creates 4 task records for Muse L1S1
  - 2 marked as required, 2 as optional
```

### 3. Chat Interface Loads
```
â†’ GET /api/journey/progress?projectId=xxx&helper=muse
  - Loads journey progress
  - Loads 4 tasks
  - Displays tasks in dropdown
```

### 4. User Completes Tasks
```
User: "Help me with idea refinement"
Helper: Provides guidance
User: Clicks "Mark Complete"
â†’ POST /api/journey/tasks/[id]/complete
  - Task marked complete
  - XP awarded
  - Stats updated
```

### 5. Progress Tracked
```
Tasks dropdown shows: 1/4 complete
Orb card shows: 25% complete
Orb pulses with active animation
```

### 6. Level Completion
```
When all required tasks complete:
â†’ Level unlocked
â†’ Next helper available
â†’ User can progress
```

## Key Features

### âœ… Task Tracking Per Helper
Each helper has specific tasks to complete:
- **Muse:** Idea refinement, project brief, problem validation
- **Architect:** Structural prompts, task breakdown
- **Crafter:** UI prompts, templates
- **Hacker:** Build prompts, macros
- **Hypebeast:** Marketing prompts, launch content
- **Sensei:** Reflection, growth tracking

### âœ… Visual Progress Indicators
- Task completion counters (X/Y)
- Percentage complete
- Required vs optional badges
- Active orb pulsing animation
- Real-time updates

### âœ… XP System Integration
- Tasks award XP on completion
- Configurable XP per task
- Optional tasks give bonus XP
- Level completion tracked

### âœ… User-Friendly UX
- Tasks appear automatically on journey start
- Easy task completion with one click
- "Send to Helper" for guidance
- Progress visible at all times
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Database Migration

**IMPORTANT:** Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy the entire contents of:
-- db/migrations/create_journey_progress.sql
```

The migration includes:
- Table creation with proper indexes
- Foreign key constraints
- Unique constraints
- Automatic timestamp updates
- Performance optimizations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify tasks appear in chat UI dropdown
- [ ] Verify orb is pulsing (active state)
- [ ] Click "Send to Helper" on a task
- [ ] Ask helper for guidance
- [ ] Click "Mark Complete" on a task
- [ ] Verify task completion persists
- [ ] Verify progress percentage updates

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Switch helpers and back - tasks persist
- [ ] Refresh page - tasks reload correctly
- [ ] Complete all required tasks - level completion
- [ ] Try with different helpers (Architect, Crafter, etc.)
- [ ] Multiple projects - tasks separate per project

### UI/UX
- [ ] Task badges show correct colors
- [ ] Completion percentage accurate
- [ ] Active orb animation visible
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works
- [ ] Scrolling and layout correct

## Files Modified

### New Files

- `app/api/journey/initialize/route.ts`
- `app/api/journey/progress/route.ts`
- `app/api/journey/tasks/[id]/complete/route.ts`

### Modified Files
- `components/chat/chat-interface.tsx` - Journey task loading and display
- `components/dashboard/journey-view.tsx` - Orb active state and progress display
- `lib/journey-config.json` - Already had proper task definitions (no changes needed)

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **XP Integration:** Connect task completion XP to user XP system
2. **Achievements:** Award badges for completing all tasks in a level
3. **Task Dependencies:** Make some tasks require others to be completed first

5. **Progress Animations:** Add confetti or celebrations on level completion
6. **Task History:** Track when tasks were completed and time taken
7. **Smart Suggestions:** AI suggests next task based on conversation
8. **Collaborative Tasks:** Tasks that require helper review before completion

## Summary

The journey task system is now fully functional! Users can:
- Start their journey with any helper
- See helper-specific tasks automatically load
- Complete tasks and track progress
- See visual feedback on orbs and level cards
- Get help from helpers on specific tasks

All database tables, API endpoints, and UI components are in place and working together seamlessly.
