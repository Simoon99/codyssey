# Task Logical Order - Journey-Wide Flow

## Overview
Reorganized all helper tasks to follow a logical progression both within each helper and across the entire VibeCoding journey. Each task builds upon previous work and prepares for the next step.

## Logical Progression Philosophy

### Within Each Helper
Tasks flow from:
1. **Foundation** ‚Üí Understanding/Setup
2. **Core Work** ‚Üí Main deliverables
3. **Application** ‚Üí Applying what was learned
4. **Integration** ‚Üí Preparing for next step

### Across All Helpers
The journey follows a natural product development flow:
**Idea ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Launch ‚Üí Improve**

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/journey-config.json`**
   - Updated task arrays for Architect, Crafter, Hacker, and Hypebeast
   - Updated firstMessage text to reflect new order

2. **`app/api/chat/route.ts`**
   - Updated initialization prompts to match new task focus
   - Adjusted questions to align with first task in each sequence

---

## Testing the New Flow

To verify the logical order:

1. **Start with Muse** - Complete all tasks, note the project brief
2. **Move to Architect** - Notice how structural prompts teach you the framework first
3. **Continue to Crafter** - See how design system guides all UI decisions
4. **Progress to Hacker** - Observe how tool selection enables technique learning
5. **Advance to Hypebeast** - Experience how strategy drives all content
6. **Finish with Sensei** - Review the natural progression

Each step should feel like a natural continuation of the previous work.
