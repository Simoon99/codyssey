## üêõ Common Deployment Issues

### Issue: Build Fails
**Symptoms:** Deployment stops during build
**Fix:**
1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Run `npm run build` locally to reproduce
3. Fix TypeScript/ESLint errors
4. Push fix and redeploy

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Working
**Symptoms:** App loads but features broken
**Fix:**
1. Verify all env vars set in Vercel
2. Check spelling (case-sensitive!)
3. Redeploy after adding vars
4. Check Vercel logs for "undefined" errors

### Issue: GitHub OAuth Fails in Production
**Symptoms:** Login redirects to error page

### Issue: Chat Not Working
**Symptoms:** No responses from helpers
**Fix:**
1. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Vercel
